                <li>
                        He never failed math. This is a popular "fact promoted on the internet",
                        maybe in an attempt to relate to genius. However, It is simply not true. 
                        Overall, Einstein was an average student, but math was one area where he
                        excelled, unsurprisingly.
                </li>
                <li>
                       Einstein encouraged the development of the nuclear bomb. His involvement is
                       often misinterpreted, with some claiming that he helped create the atom bomb.
                       In reality, what he did was write a letter to President FDR encouraging him 
                       to begin work on such a weapon, which led to the Manhattan Project. Although
                        a dedicated pacifist and, later, an anti-nuke spokesman, Einstein was convinced
                        that America needed the atomic bomb before the Nazis.
                       
                </li>
                <li>
                        He was a great musician. If the whole "genius" thing didn't work out, Einstein could
                        have become a violinist. His mother played piano so he had the love of music instilled
                        in him--via violin lessons--at the young age of five.
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                        He could have been the President of Israel. When Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann,
                        died, Einstein was offered the position, but he declined.
                </li>
                <li>
                       He married his cousin. After Einstein divorced his first wife, Mileva Maric, he married
                       his cousin, Elsa Lowenthal. He was actually, quite a bad husband to his first wife in 
                       their later years. He had affairs he never tried to hide, he moved the entire family to 
                       Berlin without discussion, and treated her more as a servant than a wife.
                </li>
                <li>
                        He won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics. This alone isn't particularly surprising. What is 
                        surprising is the fact that he didn't receive it for the general or special theory of 
                        relativity, but rather for the photoelectric effect.
                </li>
                <li>
                       He loved to sail. Ever since university, Einstein sailed as a hobby. But by his own admission,
                       he never made a particularly good sailor. In fact, he didn't even know how to swim. 
                </li>
                <li>
                        He really didn't like socks, and usually didn't wear them. In fact, in a letter to Elsa, he 
                        bragged about getting away "without wearing socks" while at Oxford.
                </li>
                <li>
                        He had an illigetimate daughter. This wasn't know until the 1980's, but according to correspondence 
                        between Albert and Mileva it was determined that the two had a daughter in 1902 called Liesrl. At 
                        one point, all mention of her in letters stopped sor her fate is unknown.
                </li>
                <li>
                       His brain was stolen. After Einstein died, the pathologist who did his autoposy took his brain without
                       permission. He eventually got the permission from Einstein's son, but he was fired from Princeton when 
                       he refused to turn the brain over. He kept it for forty years before finally returning it in 1988.
